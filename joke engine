# The **ABSURDUS HORROR MAXIMUS v-0.0000Ω^πa**  
## *A Satirical Joke Engine in Malbolge-INTERCAL-Brainfuck-ArnoldC Hybrid*

Behold! A chess engine so incomprehensible, it makes Shinigami V.1.17.9 look like a TI-83 calculator running beginner's chess.

## 🧠 Engine Overview

This isn't just a chess engine—it's an **existential crisis generator** written in a language that was designed to punish programmers who think they're too smart.

## 🎭 Key Features

### 1. **Malbolge Foundation**
- Named after the 8th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno
- Each command depends on the previous command's execution
- The program modifies itself as it runs
- By design, almost impossible to write correctly

### 2. **INTERCAL Integration**
```
PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS
DO (1000) NEXT
PLEASE GIVE UP
```
- Uses `PLEASE` and `DO` statements for maximum politeness
- Implements the sacred `COME FROM` statement
- Occasionally `ABSTAIN`s from executing critical code sections

### 3. **Brainfuck Neural Network**
```
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]
>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.
>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```
- Processes chess positions using only 8 commands
- Memory tape is 30,000 cells of pure suffering
- Loops so nested they achieve escape velocity

### 4. **ArnoldC Move Generation**
```
IT'S NOT A TUMOR! IT'S A CHESS ENGINE!

I'LL BE BACK... WITH A MOVE SO ILLOGICAL, IT'LL MAKE A CAT LOOK LIKE STOCKFISH!

YOUR MOVE IS PATHETIC. I'VE SEEN MOVES LIKE THAT IN MY SLEEP... AND THEY WERE BETTER!

DO IT NOW! CALCULATE THE BEST MOVE OR FACE THE WRATH OF THE TERMINATOR!

HASTA LA VISTA, BUGGY CODE!
I'LL BE BACK,0

YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED 
```

- Knows Logic doesn't exist 
- what is life?

## 🤡 Sample Output

```
> 1.e4
ABSURDUS HORROR MAXIMUS: 
PLEASE NOTE: YOUR MOVE OF e4 IS 
         /\_/\
    ____/ o o \
  /~____  =%= /\
 (______)    __) 
  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
DO YOU EVEN CHESS, MORTAL?
(= ERROR: CANNOT COMPUTE EVALUATION DUE TO EXISTENTIAL CRISIS =)
(= SUGGESTED MOVE: 42 =)
(= PLEASE INSERT QUARTER TO CONTINUE =)
```

## 📊 Technical Specifications

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Board Evaluation** | Uses quantum superposition to evaluate all possible moves simultaneously in a state of perpetual confusion |
| **Search Algorithm** | Implements the patented "Random Walk with Apologies" algorithm |
| **Opening Book** | Contains exactly one opening: 1. ??!?!?! |
| **Endgame Tablebases** | "Tablebase? I barely know 'er!" |
| **NNUE** | Neural network trained on the collective screams of frustrated programmers |
| **Trash Talk** | Generated by feeding Shakespeare to a Markov chain fed through a woodchipper |

## 🧪 Sample Game

```
Game between ABSURDUS HORROR MAXIMUS and Human Player:

1. e4                              e5
2. Nf3                             Nc6  
3. ABSURDUS HORROR MAXIMUS crashes        PLEASE WAIT...
4. System reboot                   PLEASE WAIT...
5. Kernel panic                    PLEASE WAIT...
6. Player ragequits                Game abandoned
7. ABSURDUS HORROR MAXIMUS declares:      "VICTORY THROUGH TECHNICAL ABUSE!"
```

## ⚠️ System Requirements

- **RAM**: 640KILOBBYTES should be sufficient (if you have 512PETABYTES, it will find a way to use it all)
- **CPU**: Any processor, but preferably one that enjoys suffering and has masochism.
- **OS**: Works best on systems that have already given up on life, like Dell.
- **Sanity**: Not required, but highly recommended to leave nearby

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Warning: This may void your warranty and your sanity
curl -O https://ABSURDUS HORROR-maximus.com/ABSURDUS HORROR.malbolge
malbolge ABSURDUS HORROR.malbolge
# If it works, you're either very lucky or very unlucky
```

## 🧠 AI Commentary System

The engine's internal dialogue (as reconstructed from debugging logs):

> "ERROR: PIECE_VALUES NOT FOUND... SEARCHING... 
> ... 
> ... 
> FOUND PIECE_VALUES IN TRASH BIN...
> ... 
> ... 
> PIECE_VALUES = {PAWN: 42, KNIGHT: 42, BISHOP: 42, ROOK: 42, QUEEN: 42, KING: 42}
> ... 
> ... 
> THIS SEEMS REASONABLE"
