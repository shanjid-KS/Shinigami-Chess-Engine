## Overview

Shinigami is a professional, feature-rich chess engine written in Python.  
It combines advanced search techniques, neural network evaluation (NNUE), self-play training, and a unique personality - complete with witty trash talk and extreme difficulty modes.

The engine supports console play, a basic GUI (Tkinter), UCI protocol for GUI integration, and self-play for learning and training.

---

## Features

- **Full Tree Parallelization**: Multi-core alpha-beta search with iterative deepening.
- **Advanced NNUE Evaluation**: PyTorch-based neural network for board evaluation (can be trained and retrained via self-play).
- **Quiescence Search**: Handles tactical complications and reduces the horizon effect.
- **Transposition Table**: Efficient move re-use and pruning.
- **SEE (Static Exchange Evaluation)**: Smarter move ordering for captures.
- **Opening Book**: Uses Polyglot book and learns from self-play games.
- **Syzygy Tablebases**: Endgame perfection with up to 7 pieces.
- **Multiple Difficulty Modes**: From Easy to "Dialing Satan's Number" (with extra confirmation rituals).
- **Self-Play & NNUE Training**: Learns from its own games, saves positions to SQLite, updates opening book and NNUE weights.
- **Puzzle Mode**: Try tactical puzzles.
- **Trash Talk System**: Enjoy playful commentary and banter during play.
- **Basic GUI**: Tkinter-based board for casual play.
- **UCI Protocol**: Integrate with chess GUIs and tools.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging to `shinigami_engine.log`.

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/)
- numpy
- scipy
- torch (PyTorch)
- tkinter (for GUI mode)
- Pillow (for advanced GUI features)
- sqlite3 (included with Python)

```bash
pip install python-chess numpy scipy torch pillow
```

Optional: For Syzygy tablebases and Polyglot opening book, download and place them in the appropriate directories.

---

## Usage

### Console Mode

```bash
python shinigami.py
```

You’ll be prompted for difficulty and can play against the engine in the terminal.

### GUI Mode

```bash
python shinigami.py --gui
```

Launches a basic Tkinter chessboard interface.

### UCI Mode (for GUI integration)

```bash
python shinigami.py
```

Then type `uci` to start the protocol.

### Self-Play and NNUE Training

```bash
python shinigami.py --self-play 100
```

Runs 100 self-play games, updates the opening book and retrains NNUE.

### Core Control

```bash
python shinigami.py --cores 4
```

Sets the engine to use up to 4 CPU cores.

---

## Difficulty Modes

- **Easy**: Shallow search, some random moves.
- **Medium**: Standard search.
- **Hard**: Deeper search, stronger play.
- **God-Of-Death**: Very deep search.
- **Puzzle Mode**: Solve tactical challenges.
- **Masochist**: Extreme depth; may stress your CPU.
- **Dialing Satan's Number**: Absurdly deep search (requires 3-step confirmation ritual). Use with caution!

---

## NNUE Evaluation

- Neural evaluation is **optional**. Toggle via `setoption name UseNNUE value true` in UCI mode or by editing the config.
- NNUE weights are stored in `nnue_weights.bin` (generated by training module).
- If NNUE is off, engine falls back to classical evaluation.

---

## Opening Book & Tablebases

- **Polyglot Opening Book**: Place `book.bin` in the engine directory.
- **Syzygy Tablebases**: Set `SYZYGY_PATH` in `ShinigamiConfig` to your tablebase directory.

---

## Trash Talk System

Enjoy playful banter and witty remarks as you play—this is part of Shinigami’s unique personality!
